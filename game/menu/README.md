## GameManager
The Gamemanager keeps track of all minigames and starts/stops them when needed.
It also has a rudimentary game selection menu that uses the Gamedisplays.

## Gamedisplay
Is used my the Gamemanagers game menu to show what the game is about.
It has a button to load the game & a popup for more detailed infos but no logic beyond that.

* **`load_game(game_cfg:ConfigFile)`** <br>
  Loads the game specified by the config file.

* **`end_game(message:String="", _status=null)`** <br>

  `_status` isn't used at the moment. It is meant for the score the player achived.

* **`_build_menu()`** <br>
  Creates a menu using Gamedisplays for the cached `game.cfg` files in `_games`

* **`_find_games()`** <br>
  Searches every folder inside "res://games/" for files called `game.cfg` and caches them in `_games` using `_load_game_cfg_file()`. <br>
  `_games` is cleared at the start.

* **`_load_game_cfg_file(path:String)`** <br>
  Loads any config file into `_games`. <br>
  Any valid .cfg will be loaded. There are no checks to prevent incorect data from loading.

## Gamedisplay
* signal **`pressed(game_file)`** <br>
  Is emitted when any load buttons of the display are pressed. <br>
  `game_file` is the config used when setup was called.
